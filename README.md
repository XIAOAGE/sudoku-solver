# Sudoku Solver (Alpha)
------
Upload the sudoku image and get the answer!
Again, this is the alpha version, improvement is coming soon.
## About this
------
A homebrew program to read the sudoku board and solve it. I did not use any machine learning framework or OpenCV because the purpose of this program is to play around with basic computer vision techniques and test my implementation of neural network.
## TODO
------
- Fix the issue on detecting borders for some images
- Use perspective transform to read digits on rotated and skewed pictures
- Deal with sudoku board with very thick grid lines
- Collect more data for training the neural net
- Implement convolutional neural net for the OCR part
- Make an OpenCV and Tensorflow version of the program
- Improve the backtracking algorithm to solve sudoku faster
- Comment the code...
